Chemex Pour over coffee

2 servings (~350 ml each):
42 grams of ground coffee (I use the 4 setting on our grinder)
700 grams water

3 servings (~350 ml each):
63 grams of ground coffee (I use the 4 setting on our grinder)
1050 grams water


1. Grind coffee and transfer to reusable metal filter in pyrex.

2. Boil water and immediately add 2x volume of water to the weight of the coffee. So if using 42 grams of coffee, add ~84 grams of boiled water. Bloom the coffee for 30-60 seconds.

3. Add 60% of the water volume as quickly as you can (ideally in less than a minute, but this isn't a big deal). So for 42 grams coffee, add a total of 420 grams of boiled water (this includes the 84 grams used to bloom the coffee). Gently swirl the Chemex to evenly distribute the grounds. You can GENTLY scrape the sides of the metal filter with a spoon to knock off the grounds that adhered to the side.

4. Add the remaining volume of water gradually (as the volume of the filter allows).

5. Remove the filter and grounds and then serve
