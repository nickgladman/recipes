Servings: One 9-inch quiche in a regular sized pie dish (not deep dish quiche)


### Ingredients
1 frozen 23-cm (9 inch) pie shell (not deep-dish)
3 tablespoons butter
	* original recipe was 1½ tablespoon
150-180 g thoroughly washed, finely diced leeks, white and light green parts only. Usually 1 large leek is sufficient
	* original recipe was 100 g
250 ml heavy cream
	* original recipe was 360
5 large eggs (Kirkland brand from Costco)
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme, or ½ teaspoon dried
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
	* 1/2 adds a nice subtle heat for me, but can be a bit much for other people
60 g grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
	* original recipe was 125 g
Large pinch of sugar
Pinch ground nutmeg
Salt and freshly ground black pepper for custard and leeks


### Instructions
Preheat the oven to 400°C. Remove the pie shell from the freezer and thaw it until just soft enough to easily prick with a fork (10 to 20 minutes). Thawing isn't necessary, but can help to prevent dough cracking if you're anxious about it. Prick the bottom and sides all over with a fork and bake on the center rack until lightly golden, 15 to 25 minutes. Don't worry if the crust cracks while baking; see note below on how to fix it. Turn the oven down to 325°C.

Melt the butter in small sauté pan over medium-low heat. Add the leeks and season with a 3 good pinches of salt and pepper (at least ~3/4 teaspoon salt and ~1/4 teaspoon pepper). Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until very soft, about 15 minutes. The point for the long cook is to make the leeks very soft and remove as much moisture as possible. Do not brown. Taste and adjust seasoning (they should be well-seasoned). Set aside to cool.


In a medium bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, eggs, thyme, nutmeg, Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, sugar, ~1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, 1/4-1/2 cayenne (depending on preference). Mix well.

Spread the cooked leeks over the pre-baked pie shell, taking care not to puncture the crust (it may be fragile around rim, or where there are air bubbles). Pour the egg mixture over top. Bake at 325°C for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the custard is set and puffed. The quiche will deflate as it cools. Slice into wedges and serve hot or warm.

Note: Don't panic if your crust cracks -- you can easily fix it. Make a smooth paste by mixing 1 tablespoon of flour with 1 tablespoon of water. Use your fingers to patch up and fill any cracks, then place the crust back in the oven for a minute or so to set. It should be good as new.


Make-Ahead/Freezer-Friendly Instructions: This quiche can be made up to a day ahead of time and refrigerated. To reheat: Cover the quiche with aluminum foil and bake in a preheated 300°F oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until hot in the center. It can also be frozen for up to 3 months. Remove the quiche from the freezer about 24 hours prior to serving and reheat it, covered with foil, in a 150°C oven until hot in the center.
