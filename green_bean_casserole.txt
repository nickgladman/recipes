Green Bean Casserole

From https://www.spendwithpennies.com/classic-green-bean-casserole/

Ingredients
4 cups frozen cut green beans thawed, see notes for canned or fresh beans
10.5 ounces condensed cream of mushroom soup 1 can
½ cup milk
1 teaspoon soy sauce
½ teaspoon black pepper
¼ teaspoon seasoned salt more to taste
1 ½ cups crispy fried onions divided

Instructions 
Preheat the oven to 350°F.

# Instructions

If using fresh or frozen green beans, boil just until tender crisp (see notes).

In a large bowl, combine green beans with soup, milk, soy sauce, pepper, salt, 1 cup of crispy onions, and cheese if using (see notes). Transfer to a 2qt or 8×8 baking dish.

Bake uncovered for 30 to 35 minutes or bubbly.

Remove from oven and stir. Top with remaining onions and return to oven for an additional 10 minutes or until golden.


Notes
Green beans: Canned, fresh, or frozen beans work in this recipe. In place of frozen beans, you can use either of the following:
drain 2 (14 ½ ounces each) cans of cut green beans
1 ½ pounds fresh green beans, trimmed and simmered for about 7-8 minutes
Optional additions:
1 ½ cups shredded cheddar cheese mixed into the sauce (favorite!)
fried mushrooms, onions, garlic, and/or shallots
Cheese: If adding cheese, you can mix the cheese in with the soup for a cheesy sauce or sprinkle it on top after stirring. I prefer to mix it into the sauce.
Slow cooker:  Prep the green bean casserole as above and cook in a 4qt slow cooker on low for about 2-3 hours. Once heated through, turn the slow cooker to warm. If your slow cooker is larger than 4qt, double the recipe.
Make ahead: This casserole can be made up to 48 hours ahead of time—store the topping on the side until baking. Remove the casserole from the fridge for at least 30 minutes before baking. You may need to add 10 minutes of extra cooking time.
Leftovers: Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
