Pao de Quijo (brazilian cheese bread)

modified From NYT Cooking
* modifications are using cassava flour instead of tapioca starch, cojita cheese instead of parmesan and mozzarella (which themselves replace Mines cheese), and increasing the cheese quantity by 20% to make a stickier interior.

INGREDIENTS (full amount; ~32 small rolls)
335 grams cassava flour (about 3 cups; Bob's Red Mill), plus more to dust your hands
	* Use same amount if using authentic Polvilho Azedo or Polvilho Dolce
	* I prefer Polvilho Azedo for the best flavor of the three options
18 grams salt (2 teaspoons)
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
	* Note: no need to add this if using authentic Polvilho Azedo or Polvilho Dolce
2/3 cup whole milk
1/2 cup canola oil
2/3 cup water
1.5 tablespoons butter, softened
2 large eggs
225 grams of cotija cheese, grated


**2/3 amount adjustment (~21 small rolls)--This makes enough for one whole sheet pan**

223 grams cassava flour (about 2 cups), plus more to dust your hands
12 grams salt (1 and 1/3 teaspoons)
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
	* Note: no need to add this if using authentic Polvilho Azedo or Polvilho Dolce
.44 cup whole milk
1/3 cup canola oil
0.44 cup water
1 tablespoons butter, softened
1.3 large eggs
	* I just beat two eggs and add ~1.3-1.5 of the quantity to the dough
150 grams of cotija cheese, grated


PREPARATION
1	In an electric mixer with a paddle attachment, blend the tapioca starch, salt and baking powder on low speed.

2 	Put the milk, oil, butter and 2/3 cup water in a small pot and bring to boil. Immediately pour it over the starch and mix at low speed until all the ingredients are blended and the dough is smooth, about 3 or 4 minutes.
	* don't add the eggs to early (next step) for fear of scrambling them

3	Stop the mixer and crack in the eggs. Mix at low speed for 8 to 10 minutes or until the dough becomes sticky (this didn't take very long for me with--maybe 4-5 minutes tops). Stop to scrape down the bowl and blade, but quickly resume the mixing. Don't worry about over-mixing too much. Dough will transform to smooth ball to cottage cheese texture then finally a cohesive stickier dough

	* if mixer is struggling and dough seems to stiff, add 1-2 tablespoons of water until it slackens up a bit (not too much)

4	Stop the mixer and pour in the cheeses. Mix on low for 40 to 50 seconds or just enough to blend the cheeses into the dough.

5	Refrigerate for 2 hours.
	* Note: Letting the dough sit for one hour is probably enough to chill it sufficiently. You can also put it in the freezer for 25-30 minutes. The dough won't get too firm--it will just be cool to the touch. But cooling for the 2 hours might help the flavor more.


NOTE: at this point, I roll out the balls into 2.5 cm (~1.5 tablespoon portion) spheres and freeze them for longer storage and bake them frozen. You can also bake them fresh after chilling for 2 hours in the fridge as the recipe originally ordered. Use oil on your hands to help form the spheres if the dough is too sticky.


6	Heat the oven to 375 degrees.

7	For freshly chilled balls, place on a baking sheet about 2 inches (5 cm) apart. (Leftover rolls can be frozen) Bake for 20 to 23 minutes, until the flecks of cheese are brown and the crust is lightly golden. For frozen breads, bake for 2-7 minutes longer (or until color is right)
	* for my gas grill at Laurel hollow, it took 26-30 minutes of baking (mine was ~28 minutes)
	* I tried baking them from frozen at 375 (Laurel Hollow oven), the first attempt at 30 minutes reached the required color, but the bottom of the bread was starting to get a little too black. Otherwise they were just as tasty as when I baked them unfrozen.
	* for Dix hills electric oven it took closer to 30-34 minutes
	* if using Polvilho Azedo or Polvilho Doce and baking from frozen, it took ~28 minutes to get it just right


# Notes

I tried using ~280 grams of shredded cotija cheese with everything else remaining constant and the results were...
