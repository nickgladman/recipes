Macarons

### Ingredients:

For a savory macaron (single batch: makes ~35-40 macarons of 2.5-3 cm in diameter):
    3 large egg whites (~100g)
	* I don't measure the weight, I just use three egg whites and it always works
    1/4 cup white sugar (50g)

    150 g confectioners' sugar
    150 g finely ground almonds
    1/4 teaspoon almond extract (optional)

**Other Ratios for more macarons: THIS IS THE RATIO I USE

(For ~55-60 macarons using piping bag)
    4 egg whites (120-140 grams)
    66.6g white sugar
    * optional: 1/3 teaspoon cream of tartar

    200 g confectioners' sugar
    200 g finely ground almonds
	* Notes: when using Kirkland brand almond flour (Costco), using 190 grams of both flour and sugar for with 4 egg whites, this will yield the desired batter density.
	

	* batter notes:
		* 120 g egg whites with 190 g + 190 g of powdered sugar and Kirkland's almond flour yielded in a pretty good batter, but the skin took >40 minutes for form and wasn't super impervious and the legs didn't form as high as previous attempts
		# a 40% ratio of egg whites to the sugar+almond flour mixture did not result in any skin formation, so for 190 grams each of flour and sugar, I add 150 g of egg whites. This required ~5 eggs. Do not use this.

### Fillings:

Vanilla (or other flavor) Buttercream (enough for a double batch of macaron sandwiches

By weight: 
8 tablespoons of butter (1/2 block Kerrygold or 1 stick; Kirklands) = 113 grams
	* always use Kerrygold if possible--it tastes better and warms up 2x as fast as US butter.
275 grams of confectioner sugar
2-3 teaspoons of concentrate flavoring (lemon, maple, vanilla, etc.)
	* I use 3 teaspoons of maple extract for the maple buttercream
	* Add the extract before any whipping cream since you might achieve the consistency before then
1-3 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream (or to desired consistency)
	* probably need 1.5-2 for Kerrygold butter


White Chocolate Ganache (easily makes enough for 20 sandwiches)

100g whipping cream
150g semi-sweet white chocolate chips



Raspberry Jam filling and Chocolate drizzle (over top of macaroon cookies)

Make raspberry jam as described in its own recipe.
For chocolate drizzle:

130 grams of semi-sweet chocolate nibs (makes just enough drizzle for ~48 cookies)





### Directions

1. Line 2 large baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.

2. Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until whites are foamy; beat in white sugar and continue beating until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks. Add in any food coloring before fully whipped. Beat to stiff peaks. Sift confectioners' sugar and ground almonds into the egg whites and quickly fold the almond mixture into the egg whites, about 30 strokes (depends on the size of your bowl and amount of batter + dry ingredients). The batter should fall off the spatula with ease, but should be gloopy and still viscous (do not over-mix and make a slack or loose batter). It's also important to not under-mix as this will not yield good skin on the macarons.
    
3. Spoon the batter into a piping bag or a plastic bag with a small corner cut off and pipe a test disk of batter, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, onto prepared baking sheet. 
	* If the disk of batter holds a peak instead of flattening immediately, gently fold the batter a few more times and retest.
    
4.  Pipe the batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks. Let the piped cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, about 0.5-1 hour depending on temperature/humidity/etc. Might take > 1 hour on humid summer days
	* You should be able to run your finger gently over the surface of the macaron without tearing the batter.
	* I space my macarons so that there are 4 rows per full backing sheet, with 6 macarons on each sheet
    
5. Preheat oven to 290 degrees F (143 degrees C).
    
6. Bake cookies until set but not browned, about 15-25 minutes depending on your oven; let cookies cool completely (~15-30 minutes)

	*note: for my oven at Greenlawn, it takes 20 minutes to reach the minimum of properly cooked macarons if cooking from the second-from-the-bottom rack. I would suggest cooking for 20-22 minutes.

	*note: for my oven (Uplands) on the center rack--one tray at a time--it takes closer to 17.5 minutes to turn slightly brown on the macaron base.

	*note: for Dix Hills electric oven 24-25 minutes (25 might be best for crust) to get a nicely toasted cookie with a golden base.

7. Make buttercream while cookies cool. Gently peel off the macarons from the parchment--they should pull off without sticking or tearing. Pipe buttercream on top of one macaron and then sandwich the frosting with another macaron.

8. I think the macarons taste better after chilling them in the fridge overnight. The buttercream and almond flavor become more pronounced for me the next day.
