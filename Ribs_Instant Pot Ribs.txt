Ingredients

    1 rack of pork ribs (*see note below)
    2 teaspoon salt
    2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    2 teaspoon garlic powder
    2 teaspoon chili powder
    2 teaspoon onion powder
    2 teaspoon light brown sugar
    1 cup water
    1/2 cup apple juice , or 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
    2 teaspoon liquid smoke , optional*
    1 cup barbecue sauce , homemade or store-bought (*see note)

Instructions

    Remove membranes from the back of ribs, if needed.
    Rubs seasonings over both sides of ribs.
    Place wire trivet rack in the bottom of the instant pot.
    Add water, apple juice (or apple cider vinegar) and liquid smoke (optional, but recommended for that great smokey flavor).
    Place the ribs upright, with the meat side facing out. If you’re using one large rack of ribs, then circle them around the pot.
    Secure lid and close vent.
    Press “manual” or “pressure cook” and cook on high pressure for 25-30 minutes.
	**if cooking two racks of ribs or pork spare, cook for ~40 minutes


    When the timer beeps, allow the pressure to naturally release for 15 min, then turn the valve to quick release.
    Carefully remove ribs to a large, foil-lined baking sheet and slather them in BBQ sauce.
    Optional: broil them in the oven for 2-3 minutes to caramelize the bbq sauce.

Notes
*For spare ribs, add 5-10 minutes to the cooking time (high number for higher altitudes and very “fall-off-the-bone” ribs, lower number for lower altitude and tender ribs).
*Liquid smoke can be found near the bbq sauces at your local grocery store. It will add an amazing smokey flavor to the ribs.
*For the BBQ sauce I prefer Sweet Baby Ray’s original, or this homemade bbq sauce.
