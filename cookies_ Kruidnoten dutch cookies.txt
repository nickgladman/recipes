Yields ~ 100 cookies

Ingredients

    1 3/4 cups/200g self-rising flour
	*to make your own at home: 
		1 3/4 cup AP flour (200 grams AP flour)
		2.5 teaspoons baking powder
		.42 teaspoons salt
	    *weight: 
    1/2 cup/100g brown sugar (â€‹donkerbruine basterdsuiker, see Tips, or pure cane sugar, demerara, turbinado)
    7 tbsp./100g butter, softened
	* I use full stick (8 tbsp) ~110 grams
    3 to 5 tbsp. milk; add more until dough comes together (I use 1%)
	* drying dough will take ~15 minutes to cook, wetter dough up to ~18 minutes.
    4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice (or speculaaskruiden)
	Can add 5 tsp for slightly more intense flavor
    1/2 tsp. baking soda
    Optional: 
	1/2 orange (zested, finely grated)

### speculaaskruiden spice mix recipe:


    4 tsp. ground cinnamon
    1 tsp. ground cloves
    1 tsp. ground mace
    3 tsp. ground ginger
    1 tsp. ground white pepper 
    1 tsp. ground cardamom 
    1 tsp. ground coriander seeds
    0.5 tsp. ground anise seeds
    1 tsp. grated nutmeg



Steps to Make It

1.    In a large mixing bowl, mix together all the ingredients (except the egg white **I don't know why this is stated here**) and knead well. You may use a mixer with a dough hook attachment here. You should be able to shape the dough into a ball without it sticking to your hands. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and set aside for an hour. so that the spices can work their magic.

	* cream butter and sugar first. Add in the milk and mix.
	* Mix together the dry ingredients, then add them dry ingredients and bring together. Do not overwork the dough.

2.    Preheat the oven to 350 F / 175 C. Grease a cookie sheet or line with parchment paper.

3.   Wet your hands and roll little marble-sized balls of dough (approx. 1/2 inch/12 mm). Place the dough balls on the cookie sheet. Using your thumb, gently press down on each ball to flatten slightly. Brush with egg white.

4.    Bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until the cookies puff up and turn a slightly darker shade of brown. Allow to cool. Wetter doughs (5 tbsp milk) will take longer to cook (~18 minutes) while drier doughs (3 tbsp milk) will only need 15-16 minutes.

Tips

    Basterdsuiker is a typical Dutch product. It is manufactured by adding invert sugar and other ingredients to fine white refined sugar. This mixture helps to achieve certain textural structures and keeps baked goods moist. There are three varieties, white, brown and dark brown, called witte basterdsuiker, (licht)bruine basterdsuiker or gele basterdsuiker and donkerbruine basterdsuiker. It is widely available from Dutch supermarkets and some Dutch groceries on the internet. I've had good results substituting the donkerbruine basterdsuiker in this recipe with pure cane sugar (demerera).
    You can order little sachets of speculaas spices (known as speculaaskruiden) online. But you can easily substitute pumpkin pie spices. You can also make your own speculaaskruiden, which really allows you to tailor things to your tastes - a little more cinnamon, or a little less cardamom - whatever you fancy.
    Kruidnoten make a great gift. Simply wrap up in some cellophane and tie with a ribbon.

Speculaaskruiden spice recipe

https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-make-speculaaskruiden-1128546

    4 tsp. ground cinnamon
    1 tsp. ground cloves
    1 tsp. ground mace
    1/3 tsp. ground ginger
    1/5 tsp. ground white pepper 
    1/5 tsp. ground cardamom 
    1/5 tsp. ground coriander seeds
    1/5 tsp. ground anise seeds
    1/5 tsp. grated nutmeg

Kitchen Notes

    If you can't find (or don't have) some of the ingredients it's okay to leave some out, but make sure you include the cinnamon, cloves, mace, and ginger.
    If you only have whole spices at home, you can grind the spices yourself using a coffee grinder, or even a food processor and a fine sieve. This will provide for a fresher, more intense flavor.

# Instructions

1. Mix spices well.

Experimental note: I used 1/2 tsp for all spices except what was originally written for cinnamon, cloves, and mace.

*results were that the spice levels for this batch of cookies was not sufficient enough. Try using 1 tsp for all spices (not including cinnamon) and increasing the amount of ginger to 3 tsp. Keep cloves and mace at 1 tsp. Used 1/2 tsp of ground anise


    4 tsp. ground cinnamon
    1 tsp. ground cloves
    1 tsp. ground mace
    3 tsp. ground ginger
    1 tsp. ground white pepper 
    1 tsp. ground cardamom 
    1 tsp. ground coriander seeds
    0.5 tsp. ground anise seeds
    1 tsp. grated nutmeg
