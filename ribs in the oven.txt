Directions
PREPARE RIBS
1 Heat oven to 275° Fahrenheit (135C).

2 If the ribs still have the thin membrane covering the back of the rack, remove it. See how in the notes section below.

3 Season both sides of the ribs with a generous amount of salt and pepper. If you are using a spice rub, add season the ribs with it now. Place the ribs, meat-side up, into a large roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet. (It may be necessary to cut the ribs in half for them to fit into the pan).
	* 
	* I use a generic rub: salt, coarse ground pepper, MSG, onion powder, garlic powder, coriander, sumac, cumin, paprika (normal or smokey for best results, not hot), and about 1/2 the entire rub volume of light brown sugar.
		* Use ~ 3 tablespoons for all seasonings to make enough for three ribs
		* use equal parts for all seasoning (i.e. 3 tablespoons each) except for the salt, msg, cumin, and sumac (salt ~1.5 teaspoons, msg 3/4 teaspoon, 1 tablespoon sumac and 1 tablespoon cumin)
	* after seasoning, I place 3 ~1 tablespoon pads across the ribs and then wrap them.
	* Don't add any spicy element to the rub.

4 Cover the pan or baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil (or wrap the rack in tight foil packets, and then place onto a baking sheet). Let the ribs sit for ~30 minutes at room temp to absorb some of the seasoning and get closer to room temp
	* I like to cook unopened for 2.5-3 hours and then wrap rack of ribs individually in 2x heavy duty foil Wrap tightly
	* alternatively, you can leave them unwrapped for the whole cook or a portion of it and then wrap when a crust forms (after 2.5-3 hours)

5 Bake until the meat falls easily from the bones, 2 ½ to 3 ½ hours. We like to check the ribs after 2 hours to see how they are progressing. The ribs are done when the meat is cooked through and tender. You can tell the ribs are done by piercing them with a sharp knife. You should have little to no resistance. You can also gently bend the ribs to see if the meat looks like it will pull away from the bone.
	* If cooking three full racks of ribs, rotate the sheet pan every hour to ensure even cooking
	* If you cook 3 full racks of ribs on the same sheet tray, it will take 3:45 to 4:15 hours to cook everything if they are wrapped. Check the internal temp after 3 hour to gauge done-ness. Cook ribs to between 200-205 Fahrenheit. One of the racks usually finishes faster than the others and the middle rack of ribs often is the slowest--you can help to cook everything more evenly by putting the smallest rack in the middle.
	* If you leave them unwrapped, cook them on sheet racks for 3 hours and then wrap with butter and cook for another 3 hours.

Let the ribs sit, wrapped, for at least 1 hour (ideally 2-3) so they can re-absorb some juices. This makes them more study to handle and easier to baste and broil the BBQ sauce in the next step.

To store for long term, double wrap tightly in aluminum foil and put in freezer. To reheat, place wrapped frozen ribs on a wire rack in 350 degree oven for 45-60 minutes until thawed and cooked through. Add a bit of water in the bottom of the wrapped ribs to help with moisture.

TO FINISH
1 Remove the ribs from the oven, discard the aluminum foil and generously brush both sides with barbecue sauce.

2 Move an oven rack near the top of the oven. Turn broiler to high and broil the ribs for 3-4 minutes, just until the barbecue sauce begins to caramelize. (Keep a close eye on the ribs while they broil so the sauce does not burn.)
	* I do this, it makes them so much tastier
	* I baste the ribs with one good coat of the BBQ sauce using a brush then broil for a several minutes until some caramelization happens with the sauce (it becomes lighter and tackier looking). Then I remove the rack and baste it with another layer and broil again until caramelized



MAKE BARBECUE SAUCE
1 While the ribs bake in the oven, make the barbecue sauce. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.
	* I usually just use Sweet Baby Ray's Original sauce. This has a nice sweet and spice to it. 

2 Add the onions and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the cumin and cook for an additional 30 seconds.

3 Add the ketchup, hot chili sauce, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar. Stir to combine, season with salt then cook for 2 minutes. Set aside in preparation for the ribs to finish roasting.


STORING AND REHEATING
1Store baked ribs, in an airtight container, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Freeze, wrapped in foil or freezer paper and in an airtight container, for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator, and then reheat.

2To reheat the ribs, wrap in foil or parchment paper and place into a 300°F oven until warmed through, about 30 minutes. If you have some leftover, slather some extra sauce that’s been warmed over the ribs before serving.
