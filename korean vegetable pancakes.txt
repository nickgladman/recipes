Equipment
Non-stick Pan
Ingredients
1 cup all purpose flour (130g)
2 tablespoons corn starch or potato starch
¾ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup cold water
avocado oil or any neutral oil for cooking
Vegetables (2 ½ cups total)
1 cup grated and squeezed zucchini (120g)
1 cup grated and squeezed carrots (95g)
½ cup thinly sliced green onion (15g)
Dipping Sauce
2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
2 tablespoons water
2 teaspoons sesame oil
2 teaspoons maple syrup
1 garlic clove, minced
½ teaspoon sesame seeds
1 teaspoon chopped green onion
Instructions
In a large bowl, add all the dry ingredients. Stir to combine. Pour in the cold water and whisk until combined. Be careful not to over mix. The batter will be thick.
Add all the vegetables in and combine until well coated.
Preheat a medium cast iron or non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add enough oil to coat the surface of the pan. Scoop batter, adjust amount depending on the size of our pan. It should sizzle when added.
Working quickly, spread the batter out as thinly as possible. Cook for 4-5 minutes over medium heat. Once it's crispy and golden brown underneath, flip. Cook for 3-4 more minutes. Add more oil to the edge of the pan if needed.
Repeat until all the batter is used up.
Slice and enjoy immediately with sipping sauce
Notes
Transfer leftovers in an airtight container and keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. You can also flash freeze and store in freezer for up to 3 months.
To reheat, place in a toaster oven, a skillet with some oil, or the air fryer.
