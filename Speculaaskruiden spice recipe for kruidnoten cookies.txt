    4 tsp. ground cinnamon
    1 tsp. ground cloves
    1 tsp. ground mace
    1/3 tsp. ground ginger
    1/5 tsp. ground white pepper 
    1/5 tsp. ground cardamom

Kitchen Notes

    If you can't find (or don't have) some of the ingredients it's okay to leave some out, but make sure you include the cinnamon, cloves, mace, and ginger.
    If you only have whole spices at home, you can grind the spices yourself using a coffee grinder, or even a food processor and a fine sieve. This will provide for a fresher, more intense flavor.

# Instructions

1. Mix spices well.

Experimental note: I used 1/2 tsp for all spices except what was originally written for cinnamon, cloves, and mace.

*results were that the spice levels for this batch of cookies was not sufficient enough. Try using 1 tsp for all spices (not including cinnamon) and increasing the amount of ginger to 3 tsp. Keep cloves and mace at 1 tsp. Used 1/2 tsp of ground anise
