Spatchcock chicken

Following is for a 7.5 pound chicken

Chicken

Butter mix:
	Parsley
	5 softened tablespoons butter
	0.5-1 teaspoon lemon juice
	Lemon zest of one lemon

Alternatively, you can use mayo instead of butter. The results are for much darker skin, almost looking burnt, over the course of a ~1.5 hour cook at 450 degrees F on the 2nd lower rack.


Instructions

Day before cooking:

Mix 4 teaspoons of salt with 1 teaspoon of baking powder.

Spatchcock bird and place on wire rack on full sheet (or quarter) sheet pan. Pat dry.

Season skin and splayed interior of chicken with salt/baking powder mix.

Place in fridge overnight (at least 12 hours, ideally 24-36 hours).



Day of cooking:

Take out bird to room temp one hour before cooking. Set oven to 450 degrees F. Separate skin from bird (but keep skin on bird)

Make butter mixture and glob 1/3-1/2 of it under the skin sections and make sure it's spread out. Knob the remaining butter over the top of the bird equally--it will melt and coat so no need to be precise about coverage.

Insert thermometer into thickest part of breast
	* after 1 hour of room temp resting, the thickest part of the breast was ~44 degrees Fahrenheit

Cook on middle rack in oven until thickest part of breast reads 155-165 degrees (you can take out at, but only do so if you're comfortable), but there is not much carry-over cooking here if left uncovered after taking out of the oven if using the middle rack of the oven, so cook to 165 if you want to be sure. Cooking on the 2nd to the lowest rack did have a good amount of carry-over cooking, around 8 degrees F

	* note: for 7.5 pound bird in Dix Hills oven, it took ~65 minutes for interior of the breast to reach 155 Fahrenheit when cooking on the middle rack
		* I took it out at 160 degrees and the carry over cook elevated it to 162 degrees after a 4 minute rest and then it started to drop, so take it out at 165 for absolute safe cooking temp
	
	* note: for ~7.5 pound bird in Dix Hills oven with rack on 2nd to lowest level, it took ~90 minutes to reach 163 degrees. I took it out and the carry over cook got to 171

You can cook chicken to 150 as long as it holds that temperature or more fro 2.7 minutes or 4.2 minutes for lean or fatty chicken respectively.
		
		

Let rest for at least 15 minutes before carving.
