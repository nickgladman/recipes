** all sizes are for a 10 inch pie tin **

# INGREDIENTS

FOR THE CRUST:
1 4/5 sleeves of saltine crackers (about 60 crackers)
1 cup softened unsalted butter (we found that 16 tablespoons of butter was the perfect amount to hold the crumbs together)
3.6 tablespoons sugar

FOR THE FILLING (originally for an 8-inch pie tin, but works well for my shallow 10-inch tins):
1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk
4 egg yolks
1/2 cup lemon or lime juice or a mix of the two
	* I used lemon only and it was very nice, but definitely try it with lime
Fresh whipped cream (about 1 cup heavy cream + 1-3 tablespoons confectioner sugar and 1-3 teaspoons vanila, whipped)
Coarse sea salt, for garnish (optional)


# INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

2. Crush the crackers finely, but not to dust. You can use a food processor or your hands. (We used our hands to ensure that we didn’t over process the crackers.) Add the sugar, then knead in the butter until the crumbs hold together like dough. Press into an 10 inch pie pan. Chill for 15 minutes, then bake for 18 minutes or until the crust colors a little.
	* for Laurel Hollow gas oven, it took 22 minutes to get some color.
	* add more butter until the consistency of the crackers is like wet sand or rice crispy mix--easy to mold and holds its shape when squeezed in your hand
	* tip: mix with one hand to keep one clean in case you need to add more butter or deal with a bothersome pet or child.

3. While the crust is cooling (it doesn’t need to be cold), beat the egg yolks into the milk, then beat in the citrus juice. It is important to completely combine these ingredients. Pour into the shell and bake for 16 minutes until the filling has set.
	* For Laurel Hollow gas oven it took 17-19 minutes to get very well set
	

4. Chill completely before serving. Serve with fresh whipped cream (we used a piping bag to top the pie with whipped cream but you can also simply spoon it on top) and (optional) a sprinkling of sea salt.
