Texas Sheet Cake

https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/the-best-texas-sheet-cake/

### Ingredients (these amounts were originally made for a 18x13 sheet pan)
*** IMPORTANT = USE 1/2 OF THE AMOUNTS FOR THE SMALL SHEET PAN I HAVE (9.5X13)

## Sponge
▢1 cup water
▢1 cup butter (2 sticks)
▢3-4 heaping Tablespoons (4 tbs = .25 cups) unsweetened cocoa powder (Caro likes it more chocolaty with 4 tablespoons, I like it with 3 tbls)
▢2 cups all-purpose flour
▢2 cups granulated sugar
▢1 teaspoon baking soda
▢1/2 teaspoon salt
▢1/2 cup buttermilk or sour cream (I use buttermilk)
	* if you want to replace the eggs in this recipe, just add 1/4 cup buttermilk per egg, so to completely replace the eggs try adding 1 cup of buttermilk
▢2 large eggs
▢1 teaspoon vanilla extract


## Sponge by weight
1 cup water
227 grams butter (2 sticks)
3-4 heaping tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder (Caro likes it more chocolaty with 4 tablespoons, I like it with 3 tbls)
240 grams AP flour
369 grams sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup buttermilk
	* if you want to replace the eggs in this recipe, just add 1/4 cup buttermilk per egg, so to completely replace the eggs try adding 1 cup of buttermilk
2 large egs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## For the Frosting
▢ 1/2 cup (8 Tablespoons) milk (can't be heavy cream: will cause frosting to sieze up)
	* either add more cream or 1 tablespoon of water to achieve more pourable and spreadable frosting
▢3.5 Tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder (Caro and I both like this level of chocolatiness)
▢3/4 cup butter (1 stick + 2 tablespoons butter)
▢4.25ish cups powdered sugar
* optional: 1/2 cup of FINELY chopped pecans


### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and grease a 18x13'' or the smaller 9.5x13 pan (adjust ingredient ratios accordingly. Place rack in the second from the bottom position.

2. Add water butter cocoa powder to a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring mixture to a boil.

3. Meanwhile, in a separate bowl mix together the flour, sugar baking soda and salt. 

4. In another small bowl mix together the sour cream, eggs and vanilla. 

5. Add sour cream/egg mixture to the flour mixture and mix until combined. 

6. Once the chocolate mixture in the saucepan in boiling, remove it from heat and pour it into the batter. Mix until combined and no lumps remain.

7. Pour mixture into prepared pan and smooth with a spatula to make sure it is dispersed in an even layer.

8. Bake in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until set (mine is usually done around 15 minutes).

	* It took ~16-18 minutes at Greenlawn
	* It took 17-19 minutest at Laurel hollow

9. When the cake is about half-way through cooking, prepare the frosting.


### For the Chocolate Sheet Cake Frosting: make ~1/6 more than above volume if using two smaller sheet pans: achieve this through milk and powdered sugar

10. Add milk, cocoa and butter to a saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil. 

11. Once boiling, remove it from the heat and stir in powdered sugar. I like to beat the mixture with my hand-held mixer to get rid of any lumps. 

12. Pour hot icing over hot cake. Use a spatula to spread it evenly over the cake. Allow frosting to set for about 10 minutes before eating.


### Notes
You can store any extra cake covered, in an air-tight container for 2-3 days.
