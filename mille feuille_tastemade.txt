Ingredients

    1 Sheet of Ready Rolled Puff Pastry (375g)

    300 milliliters Double Cream (whipping cream)

    1 Vanilla Pod

    Punnet of Strawberries

    One teaspoon Sugar

    Icing Sugar & Caster sugar for prep, decoration

Instructions

1.    Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and scatter on caster sugar.

2.    Lay over the puff pastry and trim the edges if necessary.

3.    Scatter more caster sugar over the top and cover with parchment paper. Lay another heavy baking tray on top (lined with a weight such as a pie dish) and bake for 25m at 180c (350F) or until the whole base is golden.

	*I had to cook for closer to 40 minutes with flipping at 30 minutes to achieve golden and cooked pastry. Increase temperature to 375-400 F with same baking time. Check halfway for flipping if needed.

	*For 400 F oven: cook for 30 minutes. The bottom side was nicely caramelized but the top was still pretty raw. Take out and flip next time after 20-23 minutes. Cook for a further 7-10 uncovered.

4.    Take the pastry out and dust with icing sugar and cut into even rectangles (you will be able to make 6).

5.    Whip the cream with a scraped vanilla pod and a teaspoon of caster sugar. Hull & quarter your strawberries.

6.    Lay down one rectangle of pastry and pipe on dots of whipped cream, leaving gaps that you can fill with your strawberries. Repeat this topping with a second layer and then add the third rectangle as a lid.
