Ingredients

1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
	* to to sift out any small particles or dust since they will burn easily when roasting

3 packed cups pitted dates, preferably deglet noor (about 1 pound; see headnote)
	* I just pitted some Medjool dates, but maybe a smaller date might be nicer since it'll be more bite-sized. It turned out well though using medjool

1 cup safflower oil (may substitute 16 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee)
	* need more like 20-24 tablespoons butter, use Kerrygold butter since it has higher fat compared to the Kirklands brand. The one bit of feedback I got was the roux needed more butter, so springing for ghee might be the way to go.
	* for larger roux amount use 32 tablespoons (2 cups) of butter

2.5 cups flour for 32 tablespoons butter
	* Note: needed more like 2.5-3 cups to ensure enough coverage in my tart tin

4.5 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

1.5 teaspoon ground cinnamon
	* use 1.5 teaspoons if making the larger roux amount

3 teaspoons ground cardamom

1 cup ground raw pistachios
	* get lightly salted pistachios (NOT ROASTED!) and blitz in food processor.

Directions
Step 1
Toast the walnuts in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes, shaking the pan so they donâ€™t scorch, until the nuts are fragrant and lightly browned. Let cool.

	* Note: to to sift out any small particles or dust since they will burn easily when roasting

Step 2
Line the bottom of a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom or a springform pan with parchment paper.

	* I use a ~10 inch tart pan or a 9x9 square pan, but needed to increase the roux amount to ensure full coverage when using large medjool dates

Step 3
Use the walnuts to stuff each date, arranging them in the pan in a single layer as you work; this will take 15 to 20 minutes, and it should be easy to do because the dates have been split.

Step 4
Heat the butter in the same skillet you used to toast the walnuts, over medium heat. Gradually add the flour, whisking constantly, to form a smooth and thick roux. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, whisking all the while, until the roux is a light mocha color; it picks up color especially in the last 5 minutes of cooking. Turn off the heat and stir in the sugar, until it has dissolved.
	
	* remember: it needs to be thicker so that it forms a solid dough around the dates
	* the roux can thicken a lot near the end, so add the sugar earlier than you think so it doesn't seize up the roux

Step 5
Carefully (the roux is molten hot!) transfer the roux to the pan; use an offset spatula or table knife to smooth it evenly over the dates, making sure they are completely covered. Immediately sprinkle the cinnamon and cardamom evenly over the roux, then top with the pistachios, to cover completely.

	* Combine the cinnamon and cardamom beforehand and sprinkle by hand--do not use a sieve since it will all just dump all over one spot
	* the cardamom is crucial for seasoning the roux, so make sure to use good quality cardamom and to make sure it's distributed evenly and sufficiently over the roux

Step 6
Let the date cake sit for at least an hour or two before serving.

Step 7
When ready to serve, remove the ring from the pan. Cut the cake into 18 to 24 squares (edges and bits are for the cook).
