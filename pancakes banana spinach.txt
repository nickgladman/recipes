Ingredients
2 cups rolled oats uncooked.
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp fine salt
1 tsp cinnamon
2 large eggs
1/4 cup milk of choice
1 cup mashed ripe banana (I use two bananas pieced up
	* can sub unsweetened applesauce
2 tbsp maple syrup or honey
2 tbsp melted coconut oil or avocado oil
1-2 handfuls baby spinach depending on how green you want them
	* I add in much more spinach
	* can add in other veg as well: green beans, carrots, etc.


Instructions
Add in all ingredients into a blender and blend everything until well combined and batter is smooth.
Heat a skillet over medium-low heat and add a little oil. Once hot, portion out the pancake batter into the pan.
Cook until you see small bubbles forming on the top of the pancake and the edges seem dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side for another 2 minutes. Place cooked pancakes onto a plate and continue with the remaining batter.
Enjoy warm with topping of choice. Let cook completely before storing leftovers in an air-tight container in fridge for 4-5 days or in freezer for up to a month!
