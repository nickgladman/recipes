Low and Slow Roasted Pork ShoulderLow and Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder ready to serve.
An easy, slow roasted pork shoulder cooked in the oven over low heat.


Quick Summary:
	* Use a fully thawed pork shoulder, season the exterior (and interior flap if boneless), let sit for 30-45 minutes. Bake at 450 for 45 minutes uncovered. Then drop temp to 250 and bake for 10-12 hours (usually 10-10.5 hours gets it to 205-210 degrees internal temp. The pork shoulder needs to rest for 1-2 hours before serving
	* So for pulled pork to be ready to eat at 9:30am (or finished cooking at ~7:30am and given a 2 hour rest), the pork shoulder needs to be seasoned and resting starting at ~7:45pm the night before. So basically the seasoning stage needs to start 12 hour before taking it out of the oven, or 13-14 hours before it is ready to eat.

Ingredients
2 cups apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon ketchup
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon of ground pepper
1 teaspoon salt


Instructions
Preheat oven to 450 F

Place pork shoulder on a rack in a roasting pan or on rack in a large tray with high sides.

Mix rub blend in a bowl

Rub all over the pork shoulder. Rest at room temp for 30-45 minutes.

Roast, uncovered, at 450 F for 45 minutes on the bottom rack.

Remove the pork shoulder from the oven; decrease heat to 250 F.
	* note, most recipes cook at 250, so doing 225 will take longer.

Add sliced onions, chicken broth, beer and chili flakes to the bottom of the roasting pan. 
	* I don't add this if I'm just making pulled pork; just 3 cups water and 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar to the bottom of the pan.

Baste the pork with the pan liquids.
	* Note, I do not do that.

Cover tightly with tin foil over the roast and return to the oven on the bottom rack. Check every hour or so and baste the roast with liquids from the pan; add more chicken broth if needed.
	* Note, I do not do this

Roast about 7 to 8 hours, basting every hour if you want to treat it like a roast
	* I do not baste and cook it for 10-12 hours because I like the pulled pork

	* Note: for a larger boneless pork shoulder in my Dix Hills oven at 250 F, it measured 210 after ~11 hours of cooking.

	* Note, another large boneless pork shoulder in Dix Hills oven at 250 took ~10.5 hours to read 210, so probably 10 hours for a fully thawed boneless pork shoulder is good.

The roast is done when the internal temperature is 170-175 F. For pulled pork, the temperature needs to hit 205 F

Let the roast rest for 20-30 minutes. Remove skin and fat before carving.
