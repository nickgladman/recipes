Adapted from Kirkland Signature Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chip recipe

Ingredients (volume)
3/4 cups butter (softened)
1 cup dark brown sugar (packed)
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 eggs (large)
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups all-purpose flour
	* note: this does not seem to be sufficient, add more flour until batter is more firm.
2 cups chocolate chips


Ingredients (weight) https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/learn/ingredient-weight-chart
3/4 cups (1.5 sticks, 170 grams) butter (softened)
213 grams light brown sugar (packed)
	* original recipe called for dark brown sugar
99 grams granulated sugar
2 eggs (large)
	* for Bob's Red Mill Egg Replacer, add 1 tbsp more water (so a total of 2 tablespoons Egg Replacer + 5 tablespoons water)
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
320 grams all-purpose flour
	* 300 grams of flour might result in slacker cookies, but 320 grams had good results.
2-2.5 cups of semisweet chocolate chips (or to your preference)




### Directions
1. Combine butter, sugar and brown sugar in a medium-size bowl. Blend with a mixer until smooth.

2. Add eggs and vanilla extract. Mix thoroughly with an electric mixer on medium speed.

3. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Slowly add dry ingredients until thoroughly blended. Fold in chocolate chips with a spatula.

4. Chill cookie dough enough to mold them into balls and then freeze. Can be cooked immediately if they are chilled sufficiently. I prefer to let them chill for 24 hours in the fridge. Yields about 30 cookies.

4. Bake at 350 for 13-18 minutes. This will change based on cookie size and the amount of cookies on each baking sheet.
	* for laurel hollow gas oven, place rack second from the top, and cook with speed bake function on (fan), took 12.5-16 minutes, middle was still quite soft. 13.5 minutes was the sweet spot.
	* for dix hills electric range, middle rack (with pizza stone) took 17-20 minutes to get nice and browned for the larger cookies. 15-17 for smaller cookies
	* time didn't change if adding cream of tartar
	* for 375 oven, it took between 13-14 minutes (Dix Hills electric oven)
