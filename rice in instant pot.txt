Rice in the instant pot

1. Scoop 2.5 cups of rice into a fine strainer.

2. Wash the rice thoroughly under the tap with cold water for a couple minutes or wash in a bowl until the water is clear and not cloudy.

3. Transfer washed rice to the instant pot.

4. Pour in 1.5 cups of water. Cover and seal properly with lid. Make sure vent gauge is properly situated.

5. Select "Rice" setting on Instant Pot. The Intent Pot will automatically start after a couple of seconds. The instant pot will take several minutes to build up pressure until it reaches correct pressurization. Then the panel will start a 10 minute timer.

6. Once the timer ends. Turn off the Instant Pot and immediately vent the gauge (use a long wooden spoon so you don't get a steam burn).

7. Once vented, transfer rice to container or eat immediately. If keeping in fridge, transfer storage dish immediately into the refrigerator.
