I made this in 2023 and it is tasty--I didn't have the alcohol at the time, but it was still tasty.


Active Time: 25 mins
Total Time: 35 mins
Ingredients
1/2 pound chicken livers, well-trimmed

1/2 small onion, thinly sliced

1 small garlic clove, smashed and peeled

1 bay leaf

1/4 teaspoon thyme leaves

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to season

1/2 cup water

1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature

2 teaspoons Cognac or Scotch whisky

Freshly ground black pepper

Toasted baguette slices, for serving

Directions
Gather the ingredients.

In a medium saucepan, combine the chicken livers, onion, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Add the water and bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the livers are barely pink inside, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.

Discard the bay leaf. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the livers, onion, and garlic to a food processor; process until coarsely pureed.

With the machine on, add the butter, 2 tablespoons at a time, until incorporated.

Add the Cognac, season with salt and pepper, and process until completely smooth.

Scrape the pâté into 2 or 3 large ramekins. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the pâté and refrigerate until firm.

Serve chilled.
