Frozen shrimp in the oven

Preheat oven to 425.

Wash shrimp quickly to remove ice chunks

Spray with oil and season as desired (salt, pepper, or old bay)

Bake for 10-12 minutes or until opaque and firm to touch--all of the grey color needs to be gone from the entire shrimp
	* for a full tray of shrimp at Dix Hills: it took >12 minutes for all the grey on the shrimp to go away, try 14-16
