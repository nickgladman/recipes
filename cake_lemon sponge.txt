## Ingredients

170 g butter, well softened, plus extra for greasing

	*originally 225 g butter, well softened, plus extra for greasing

225 g caster sugar
4 large eggs (room temp)
finely grated zest 3-4 lemon
1/3 cup lemon juice--should be able to get if from the 3-4 lemons
225 g cake flour

	*originally = 225 g self-raising flour, sifted	
	
2 teaspoon baking powder (actually 1.8 teaspoon)
1/2 teaspoon baking soda (actually 0.45 teaspoon)
1 teaspoon salt (actually 0.9 teaspoon)
55 grams (~1/4 cup) of plain yogurt or sour cream

## For The Filling (original recipe)

200 g icing sugar, plus extra for dusting
100 g butter, well softened
2 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
5 tbsp. lemon curd
Directions


### Custom Filling: vanilla whipped cream

    1 cup heavy (35%) cream, chilled
    Icing Sugar 4 tbsp (23 g) Redpath ® Icing Sugar
    Vanilla extract to taste (I use 2 teaspoons)

	*beat on high until very stiff peaks. Spread in between layers

    *To use this as the filling and top icing, just triple the amounts.

### Custom Icing:

1.5 sticks butter
Powdered sugar to taste
Heavy cream to texture
1.25 teaspoons lemon extract or vanilla extract
~0.5 teaspoons almond extract
Food coloring

	*NOTE: THIS VOLUME WAS **BARELY** ENOUGH FOR A CRUMB COAT AND LIGHT LAYER OF ICING FOR JUST THE TOP OF THE CAKE, USE 2.5 STICKS OF BUTTER FOR MORE ELABORATE ICING AND MORE LIKE 3-4 STICKS OF BUTTER FOR FULL CAKE CRUMB COAT AND ICING.


## Directions

1.    Preheat the oven to 170°C (340 F fan, otherwise 350 F). Grease two 20cm loose-bottomed sandwich tins with a little butter and base line with baking parchment

2.    To make the cake batter. Combine the dry ingredients and whisk well: sifted cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a food processor, blitz the sugar and lemon zest.

3. Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, cream the butter and sugar. Then add the eggs. Beat well to get some lift from the eggs.

4. Mix in the dry ingredients into the wet. Do not overbeat, but make sure there are no lumps. Add yogurt and lemon juice and blend at the end 

5.    Place the cakes on the same shelf, in the middle of the oven, and bake for around 20-25 minutes until well risen and beginning to shrink away from the sides of the tins. Cool for 5 minutes. Run a round-bladed knife around the edge of each cake and turn out onto a wire rack. Leave to cool.

6.    To make the filling, sift the icing sugar into a large bowl and add the butter and lemon juice. Blend in the food processor until smooth and creamy.

7.    Place one of the cakes on a plate. Using a rubber spatula, spread the cake with icing, taking care not to lift the sponge. Spoon the lemon curd on top and sandwich with the other cake. Dust lightly with sifted icing sugar and serve.
