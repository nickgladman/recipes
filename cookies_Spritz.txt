Source: Best Crocker Picture Cookbook (modified by family)


###Ingredients
1 cup butter, softened
2/3 cup sugar
3 egg yolks
1 teaspoons vanilla flavoring (to taste)
1 teaspoon almond extract (to taste)
2 1/2 cup AP flour


###Methods

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

2. Mix first 5 ingredients thoroughly.

3. Work the flour in with hands (stand mixer or electronic mixer is also fine)

	* if the dough is too sticky to come off onto the cookie sheet from the press, add more flour slowly until the dough becomes a smooth, soft, very pliable dough.

4. Force dough through cookie press onto an ungreased cookie sheet. CHECK WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF DOUGH FIRST TO MAKE SURE IT IS NOT TOO STICKY, IF IT IS, ADD MORE FLOUR.

	* Only cook the same shape of cookie together on the same tray to avoid overcooking smaller cookies or undercooking larger cookies.

5. Bake 7 to 10 minutes at 400 degrees F.
