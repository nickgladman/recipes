Makes about 1½ cups

3 heads of garlic, cloves peeled
1.5 cups (or more) grapeseed oil

Optional:
6 thyme sprigs
3 small bay leaves
3 dried red chiles, such as chiles de arbol


Preheat oven to 250° F. Place garlic and oil in a small ovenproof saucepan (add more oil if cloves aren’t submerged). Cover and bake until cloves are golden and tender, about 2 hours. Let cool; transfer garlic and oil to an airtight container and chill.
	* Using the pre-peeled garlic container will take ~2.5 hours in the Dix Hills oven

Do ahead: Garlic can be cooked 2 weeks ahead. Keep chilled. Bring to room temperature before using.
