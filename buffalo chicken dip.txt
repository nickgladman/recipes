Buffalo chicken dip sauce

From Sam Dietz

Buffalo Sauce
~ 2/3 cup of franks red hot original 
~ 1/4 tsp cayenne 
~ dash garlic powder
1-2 tbsp apple cider vinegar depending on acidity preference
~ 1/3 stick of butter (I use salted)
Combine everything and stir over low-med heat until butter is melted and sauce is heated

Dip:
	⁃	Both chicken breast from a rotisserie chicken
	⁃	Two blocks plain cream cheese
	⁃	All of the buffalo sauce 
	⁃	1/2 to 1 cup ranch dressing
	⁃	Sharp cheddar, shredded

	1.	Make Buffalo sauce
	2.	Add chicken to sauce and stir to coat
	3.	Cube and add cream cheese, stirring to melt and combine 
	4.	Add handful of cheddar and desired amount of ranch dressing, stir to melt and combine.
	5.	Top with as much cheese as desired and broil!
	6.	Enjoy :)

Typically I taste test as I go and adjust proportions depending on how cheesy or spicy or saucey I’m feeling that day.
