Ingredients
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
4 cups unsalted pecans halves
	* Note: a 2 lb/32 oz/ 908 g bag of pecans (Kirkland) will make just over 2 batches worth of this

*optional*
	1 tablespoon ground cinnamon (the original recipe called for this, but I don't like cinnamon very much with pecans)

Batter: 
1 egg white
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon water

Note: The above amounts covers one full sheet tray nicely, so if you double everything you'll need a second sheet tray and/or do the roasting in batches.


Instructions
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with a Silpat baking mat or parchment paper and set aside (I used parchment paper).

In a medium bowl, add sugars, cinnamon, and salt. Whisk until combined. Set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk the egg white, vanilla, and water together until frothy. Add the pecans and gently toss until the pecans are well coated. Add the sugar and cinnamon mixture and toss until pecans are covered.

Spread the pecans out in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Bake for about 30-45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes. The sugar mixture will harden on the pecans.
	
	* For Dix Hills, I cooked the pecans for 36 minutes and it seemed to harden the candy shell and the pecans looked nicely roasted underneath


Remove from the oven and let the pecans cool on the baking sheet. When completely cool, store in an airtight container for up to 1 month.


Notes
Makes about 4 cups
