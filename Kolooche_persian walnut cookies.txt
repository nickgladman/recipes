Method.

Preheat oven to 350 after dough rests

1.Combine eggs, sugar, yogurt milk, water, and butter. Mix well. Mix yeast, sugar and water and leave to activate for 5 minutes (not necessary if using instant yeast)
6. Add the salt, instant yeast, and baking powder to the flour and mix. Add dry mix to wet mix in stand mixer (maybe do in 1-2 batches for better incorporation)
7. Knead the dough until it's firm--do in stand mixer to get gluten formation-maybe just under the window-pane test level of gluten formation?
8. Cover and leave to rise for 45 minutes until doubled in size.
9. Prepare the filling by combining all ingredients well.
10. Knock back dough to release any air
11. Divide into 16 equal pieces and fill walnut mix (~2 tablespoons each?). Seal and press to flatten--flatten the cookies a lot, they will rise so you don't want them looking like buns
12. Brush with egg wash 
13. Decorate with a press or piping nozzle
14. Sprinkle with sesame seeds or poppy seeds (optional)
15. Poke each cookie several times around the perimeter with a toothpick to create vents for air to escape
16. Bake in a preheated oven 350 for 15-25 minutes
