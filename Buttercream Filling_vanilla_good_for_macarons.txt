*By Weight*

8 tablespoons of butter (1 stick) = 113 grams
	* use high quality, high-fat butter for this (ex: Kerrygold)
275 grams of confectioner sugar (this dose makes it very sweet)
1-3 tablespoons (15-45 ml) of room temp heavy whipping cream or whole milk (to consistency)
2 teaspoons of concentrate flavoring (lemon, maple, vanilla, etc.)
Smallest pinch of salt
