* My second-largest metal bowl weighs 695 grams empty
* My stand mixer bowl (metal) weighs 780 grams empty

** Note: the below cake batter ingredient quantity made enough for two slim 9-inch cake rounds, tall enough really just for two good-sized sponge layers, so use this quantity for a double layer cake, it must be increased by at least ~50% to make enough for a 4 layer cake with thinner layers and 100% for a 4-layer cake with good sponge height intervals.
	* this quantity would be probably good for 9x2 inch round cake tins
	* serves 15

### INSTRUCTIONS

Chocolate Cake:
1 Preheat oven to 350F, grease two 8" round baking pans and dust with cocoa powder. Line bottoms with parchment.
	
	* I use my 9 inch baking pans

2 Place all dry ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Stir to combine.

3 In a medium bowl whisk all wet ingredients (pour hot water in slowly as not to cook the eggs).

4 Add wet ingredients to dry and mix on medium for 2-3 mins. Batter will be very thin.

5 Pour evenly into prepared pans. I used a kitchen scale to ensure the batter is evenly distributed.

6 Bake for 30-45 mins or until a cake tester comes out mostly clean. 

	* for my oven at Greenlawn with a single 9 inch tin (serving 12 half batch, with 2/3 less cocoa), it took 35 minutes for a skewer to come out clean.
	* for the double batch (serves 24), both tins took 55 minutes to cook fully, but I was doing very quick doneness checks starting at 35 minutes, so it might take less time with the oven door closed for longer


7 Cool 10 minutes in the pans then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. 

	* I cooled the cake for 15 minutes and then turned it out onto the wire rack


### Cherry Liqueur Syrup:

8 Place sugar and water into a small pot. Stir and bring to a boil. Simmer for 1 min then remove from heat. Stir in cherry liqueur and allow to cool completely.


### Whipped Cream Frosting:
9 Whip cream and powdered sugar until stiff peaks. Ideally in a cold bowl with a cold whisk.


### Chocolate Bark: tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y9-EgrSPMg

10 Melt chocolate over a double boiler or in 20 second bursts in the microwave.

11 Using a large offset spatula, spread melted chocolate in a thin layer on a large sheet of parchment.

12 Roll up from the short side of the parchment. Place on a baking sheet and refrigerate or freeze until firm.

13 Unroll to create chocolate bark. 


### Assembly:

13 Cut each cake layer in half horizontally.

14 Place one layer of cake on a cake stand or serving plate. Brush generously with cherry syrup. 

15 Top with approximately 1 cup whipped cream and spread evenly. Top with approximately 1 cup of cherries and gently press them into the whipped cream. Repeat with remaining layers and frost the outside of the cake.

16 Decorate with chocolate bark, chocolate shavings, rosettes, and cherries if desired.
