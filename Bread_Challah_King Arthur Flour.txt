Dough

    113g lukewarm water
    74g vegetable oil
    85g honey
    2 large eggs
    482g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
	* try 500 g (when using 482 the dough didn't pull away from the sides of the stand mixer)
    1 1/2 teaspoons salt
    1 tablespoon instant yeast

Half portion:

    57g lukewarm water
    37g vegetable oil
    43g honey
    1 large eggs
    241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
    3/4 teaspoons salt
    1/2 tablespoon instant yeast

Glaze

    1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water

Instructions

1.    To make the dough: First, weigh your flour; you’ll find its weight by toggling to “ounces” at the top of the ingredient section above. Or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.

2.    Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix and knead them, by hand, mixer, or bread machine, until you have a soft, smooth dough.

3.    Allow the dough to rise in a plastic wrap-covered bowl for about 2 hours, or until it's puffy; it won't necessarily double in bulk.

4.    Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface.

5.    Next step: divide the dough into pieces, the number depending on what kind of braid you want to make. You may braid the challah the traditional way, into a three-strand braid; for helpful tips watch our video, How to braid a three-strand loaf. For a fancier presentation, make a six-strand braid; watch our video, How to braid a six-strand loaf, to see how it's done. To make a four-strand braid see "tips," below.

6.    Once you've decided which braid you're doing, divide the dough into the appropriate number of pieces. Roll each piece into a rope about 20" long. If the dough starts to shrink back as you roll, cover it and let it rest for about 10 minutes, then resume rolling. The short rest gives the gluten a chance to relax.

7.    Braid the loaf. Remember, for three- or six-strand braids, watch the videos linked above. For a four-strand braid, see "tips," below.

8.    Gently pick up the braided loaf, and place it on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.

9.    Cover the loaf with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let it rise until it's very puffy, 90 minutes to 2 hours at cool room temperature. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375°F.

10.    To make the glaze: Whisk together the egg and water. Brush the glaze over the risen loaf.

11.    Place the baking sheet atop another baking sheet; this will insulate the bread's bottom crust, and keep it from browning too much. Put the challah in the lower third of the oven, and bake it for 20 minutes. If it's a deep golden brown, tent it loosely with aluminum foil. If it's not as brown as you like, check it again at 30 minutes.

	* for Greenlawn oven, it took 25 minutes of uncovered baking to reach 190 degrees F and a nice golden brown

12.    Once you've tented the challah, bake it for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until the loaf looks and feels set and its interior registers at least 190°F.

13.    Remove the bread from the oven, and place it on a rack to cool.

14.    Store any leftover bread, well wrapped in plastic, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage. While challah does tend to dry out after a day or so, it's always good toasted, or made into grilled sandwiches or French toast. 


** Retardation notes **

## Trail 1: Success! (Greenlawn electric oven)
May 31, 2021: I made a half batch at 5:51 pm (might have over-mixed in the stand-mixer), and let it ferment for 2 hours before doing a 1-strand plait. I covered it with greased plastic wrap and placed it in the fridge starting at 7:53.

Took it out from the fridge at 5:25am the next morning and started preheating the oven at the same time. After 30 minutes (5:55am), the loaf still felt quite chill to the touch, but I nonetheless glazed it and put it in the oven at 375 F.

After 20 minutes, the internal temp was ~113 F. The color was a nice golden brown, so I tented it with aluminum foil and backed for an additional 5 minutes--it was then at 150 F. I replaced the loaf again, tented again, for another 5 minutes. After this last bake, the thickest part of the plait read ~192-193F. So I removed it and put it on a rack to cool.

	* End result: bake uncovered at 375 for 20 minutes. Tent with aluminum foil and bake for a further 9-10 minutes. This yielded a golden brown exterior and a fully cooked interior. The crumb was consistent with my regular bakes, so this method seems to work well.

## Trial 2:
September 16
I made a half batch at 7:15 pm (might have over-mixed in the stand-mixer), and let it ferment for 2 hours 45 minutes before doing a 1-strand plait. I covered it with greased plastic wrap and placed it in the fridge starting at 10:05pm. 

I took it out to room temp at ~5:40am. I turned on my gas stove at ~6:15. The dough looked puffy. It was still slightly cold to the touch, but I put it in the oven, directly over a pizza stone at 6:30. After 20 minutes of baking, the internal temp was ~160 F. I tented the loaf with aluminum and baked for a further 5 minutes. The internal temp was ~200 F after this. So for future bakes:

23-24 minutes of uncovered baking at 375. Loaf should be perfect. Check to see if it needs to be tented for the last 4-5 minutes.
