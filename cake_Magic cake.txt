Lemon Magic Cake

Ingredients
4 eggs at room temperature, separate yolks from whites
150 grams sugar
113.5 grams butter unsalted, melted
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon extract
	* original recipe only called for lemon zest and juice, but it wasn't flavorful enough
93.75 grams all-purpose flour
61 grams lemon juice freshly squeezed (enough from one lemon)
12 g lemon zest
	* ~ 1 lemon's worth
427 ml milk lukewarm*
	* Lukewarm milk refers to milk that is warmed to a temperature between 95°F and 105°F (35°C to 40°C).
powdered sugar for dusting cake

Note: this recipe makes ~1040 grams of batter and fills a standard 8x8 square pan very high, near the top of the rim. So if making two, then consider doubling this recipe


Instructions
Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Grease a 8x8 inch baking dish or line it with parchment paper.

Separate eggs and add the egg whites to a mixer and mix until egg whites are stiff. Place egg whites in a bowl and set aside.

Beat the egg yolks with the sugar until light and fluffy.

Add butter and vanilla extract and continue beating for another minute or two until well incorporated.

Sift in the flour and mix until the batter is smooth and well combined.

Add lemon juice and lemon zest then slowly start adding the milk and beat until everything is well mixed together.

Add the egg whites, a third at a time and gently fold them in using a spatula or a whisk, repeat until all egg whites are folded in, but there should still be white bits of egg whites floating in the batter.

Pour batter into baking dish and bake for 40 to 70 minutes or until the top is lightly golden and the cake is firm to the touch. The baking time could vary greatly depending on the oven, so take a peek at around 40 minutes and see how it looks.

	* For Dix Hills oven using a single batch in a 8x8 square cake pan, this took 45-55 minutes

Let the cake cool at room temp completely and then chill in the fridge for a few hours or preferably overnight.

Sprinkle some powdered sugar after cake has cooled. Cut it into squares and serve.
