### Ingredients
2 ½ cups freshly, finely grated Jarlsberg cheese
¾ cup mayonnaise
	* I have used Kewpie mayo and it worked well
3 tablespoons minced red onion
	* I use 1/2 of a medium red onion
2 tablespoons whole milk
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
	* I use dried parsley flakes and it worked fine
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon
	* I use the juice of one whole lemon
pinch of kosher salt and pepper

Optional:
	* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives, for topping

### Instructions 

Combine all the ingredients (except the chives) together and mix until combined. Cover and stick in the fridge for at least 2 hours or even overnight.
	* I found that letting it sit for 2 days (~36 hours) allows all the flavors to blend nicely. Any shorter duration and it was a bit too salty

When ready to serve, taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed. Sprinkle with chives. Serve as a spread or dip with crackers, pretzels or chips!
