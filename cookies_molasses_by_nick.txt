### INGREDIENTS (weight) (modified by nick--use these measures)
  
3/4 cups unsalted butter at room temp (12 tablespoons; 170 grams)
213 grams light brown sugar
170 grams molasses
1 egg or 1 unit egg replacer (room temp)
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cardamom
1 teaspoon nutmeg
4 teaspoons ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon baking soda
405 grams All Purpose flour

For rolling cookies:
~99 grams granulated sugar (no need to be precise, ~1/2 cup of sugar)


### INGREDIENTS (volume) original volumes from original recipe (not modified by nick, don't use these)
  
3/4 cups unsalted butter
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup molasses
1 egg
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
2 teaspoons ground ginger
	* note: we like it more gingery, so add 4 teaspoons total
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon baking soda
2 3/4 cups all purpose flour

For rolling cookies:
1/2 cup granulated sugar


### INSTRUCTIONS
 
1. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. ~1-2 minutes

2. Mix in molasses and the egg until well incorporated. I mix at medium-high speed on the stand mixer for 5-7 minutes until fully incorporated and aerated.

3. Combine the flour cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, salt, and baking soda and mix well.

4. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients on low speed, just until combined.

5. Cover and chill in the fridge at least 2 hours, ideally 12-24 hours for maximum flavor.

6. Preheat oven to 350.

7. Roll dough into 1 1/2" balls and roll them in the granulated sugar until coated.

	* I stored mine in the freezer in a freezer bag and cook from frozen.

8. Place dough balls 2" apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.

9. Bake for ~15-17 minutes depending on your oven and desired doneness (until nicely brown--not light brown):

	* If baking from frozen, cook for ~16 minutes (11 minutes left a very gooey interior).
	* For Laurel Hollow gas stove, use fan and cook for 13 minutes at 350 F
	* For Dix Hills electric stove, cook for ~15-17 minutes
		* for two pans at once Dix Hills: bottom rack and 2nd from top, switch pans at 7-8 minutes and rotate front to back. Cook for a total of 16-18 minutes (depending on how long the oven is open during the pan switch)
		* if cooking more than 6 on a sheet tray at the same time, it might need 17+ minutes to get properly cooked. For 8 cookies on a sheet, try 18 minutes

10. Let cool a few minutes on cookie sheet before transferring wire racks to cool completely.

Store in an air tight container.
