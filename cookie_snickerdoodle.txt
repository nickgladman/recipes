Prep Time: 20 mins
Cook Time: 10 mins
Total Time: 30 mins


Ingredients (volume)

1 ½ cups white sugar

½ cup butter, softened

½ cup shortening
	* or just use 1 cup of butter

2 large eggs

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons cream of tartar

1 teaspoon baking soda

¼ teaspoon salt


Cinnamon-Sugar Coating:

2 tablespoons white sugar

2 teaspoons ground cinnamon






Ingredients (weight)

297 grams white sugar (can just round up to 300 grams)
	* optional: try 200 g white sugar + 100 g light brown sugar

226 grams butter, softened (1 cup, 16 tablespoons, 2 sticks)

2 large eggs

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

400 grams all-purpose flour (original recipe called for 330 grams)
	* try 370 grams of flour for a trial with a less stiff cookie

2 teaspoons cream of tartar

1 teaspoon baking soda

1/4 teaspoon salt


Cinnamon-Sugar Coating (original recipe called only for white sugar and ground cinnamon):

4 tablespoons white sugar

4 teaspoons ground cinnamon

*optional add ons*

	1/2 teaspoon nutmeg

	1/4 teaspoon mace

	1/4 teaspoon coriander

	1/8 teaspoon ground allspice

	1/8 teaspoon ground anise




Directions
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Make cookies: Beat sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth and creamy. About 5 minutes on the stand mixer

Whisk flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Gradually mix dry ingredients mixture into the wet ingredients just until combined. Shape dough into walnut-sized balls.

Make cinnamon-sugar: Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl or zip-top plastic bag.

Place > 1 heaping tbsp-sized dough balls in cinnamon-sugar and roll or shake until coated. Place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets (I use parchment paper). Can also freeze them until baking later, just adjust cooking time (see below)

Bake in the preheated oven until set but not too hard, 8 to 10 minutes, switching racks halfway through.
	* if baking from frozen:
	* The Dix Hills oven took 13-15 minutes (14 minutes left the bottoms nicely golden brown except for the smaller cookies) to bake the cookies until they were cooked through but not over-done. No need to rotate rack halfway through.

Remove from the oven and let cool sufficiently before transferring to wire rack to cool completely
