Trial 1
09-15-2018

Ingredients

50 grams green onions (scallions)--this is about one good size bunch at the store
400 grams of roughly shaven and spun down (dried) lettuce
50 grams of shitaki mushroom heads, diced
700 grams 70% lean ground pork
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
0.75 teaspoons ground ginger
2 tablespoons toban djan sauce
50 grams sugar
Dumpling wrappers (100+) *check dumpling wrappers for dehydrated edges.

Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl.
Take ~tablespoon sized chunk and place into the middle of a wrapper, dob water around the edges and fold over and crimp to seal.



Notes:
This amount will make ~100 dumplings (northern style--thicker wrapper)

From start to finish the whole process took about 2-2.5 hours

Freeze immediately or cook some on the spot.

**For cooking frozen dumplings:

Cooked in a pan for 4.5 minutes. Then added ~80 ml of water + 1-2 tablespoons of corn starch with a bit of soy sauce and steam covered for 7 minutes

**Trial 1 Taste notes

Note= no dumplings were tried fresh, all were frozen before cooking.

Cooked in a pan for 4.5 minutes. Then added ~80 ml of water + 1-2 tablespoons of corn starch with a bit of soy sauce and steam covered for 7 minutes

Flavor was fine, but nothing really special.

Try adding more dark soy, ginger, and sugar.

11/2/2024
# this made 137 dumplings
2.5 lbs pork (1100 grams)
1 bunch green onions finely chopped
1/3-1/2 shredded small head of green cabbage (washed and thoroughly dried)
2 tablespoons onion powder
2 tablespoons garlic powder
4 tablespoons soy sauce
4 tablespoons dark soy sauce
1.5 teaspoons ground ginger
0.5 tablespoons sesame oil
2 teaspoons sugar
1 teaspoon MSG

Mix together thoroughly and add corn starch to thicken as necessary so that filling can hold shape and is not overly wet. Put ~1 heaping teaspoon into gyoza or similar wrappers. Fold and freeze until frying in pan
	* no corn starch was necessary

Not included this time, but used previously:
2-3 teaspoons ground Szechuan peppercorns (mortar ground and filtered through metal sieve)
0.5 tablespoons black vinegar

Tasting notes for 11/2/2024: These were solid dumplings, they were savory and well-seasoned with the soy. The flavor of the pork was subtle and overall the other flavors were not very prominent, so next time I would add:

1/2-1 teaspoon of freshly ground, filtered Sichuan peppercorn
Using minced ginger instead of pre-ground ginger
Increasing sesame oil to 1 tablespoon
Increasing msg to 1 tablespoon
Increasing sugar to 4 tablespoons


Possibly add oyster sauce
Look into adding Chinese five spice.
