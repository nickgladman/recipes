Honey Crystal Almonds

 

2 cups whole almonds

1/4 c. honey

2 Tablespoons butter

1 c. turbinado sugar (i.e., Sugar in the Raw) (use a lot more to be like mom's recipe)

 

1. Spread almonds in a shallow pan.  

2. Preheat oven to 325 F and bake for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally (can do 350F for 7-10)
	* For Dix Hills: 13 minutes yielded good results, but if cooking double batch in single tray, increase to 15 minutes

	* Alternatively: Place in cold oven; turn oven to 350 degrees and roast 12 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until well roasted.

		* Uplands: 20 minutes yields nice results

3. Over medium heat in medium saucepan, heat honey and butter to boiling.  Reduce heat to medium low, simmer 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.

	*Uplands: start with about 7 minutes before the almonds come out of the oven (for a double batch).
	* Same for Dix Hills (setting #4 on range), maybe start 1-2 minutes sooner for double batches

4. Add almonds straight from oven; simmer and stir 2 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer almonds to baking sheet lined with waxed paper sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.  

5. Spread in single layer and cool slightly. I cooled them for 2-3 minutes, until warm/hot, but not scalding to the touch.

6. Toss almonds with sugar, while warm, to coat using a medium plastic food storage bag.

	*I drop 1/2 of the sugar into a big metal bowl and drop the almonds in, then coat with the remaining 1/2 and mix by hand.  

7. Pour out of bag and cool completely before storing.
