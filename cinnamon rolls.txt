Cinnamon Roll Recipe (from Betty Crocker originally, I believe)

1 pkg. jumbo biscuits (any refrigerated brand: 8 per tube)
	I use store brand jumbo flaky biscuits

In one bowl:
1/4 cup melted butter
1/2 tsp. vanilla

In a second bowl:
1/2 cup sugar
1-2 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 tsp almond extract

Directions

Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees. I would put a large sheet tray on the bottom rack, maybe lined with foil or parchment paper, to catch any sugar runoff and prevent burning on the oven floor.

Compress the biscuits into more flattened cylinders.  Dredge into butter mix. Knock off the excess butter.

Drop into the sugar mix. Flip the dough over a couple times to get equal coverage around the biscuit

Fold up the biscuit by pinching opposing ends together and put seam side down into ungreased, non-stick muffin pan. You want the folded up biscuit to sort of look like a hot-air balloon.

Bake at 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes, until they start to brown on the top. You can let sit in the pan for a few minutes or take out immediately and let sit for a while (they are molten-lava hot on the inside).

This recipe is very forgiving: you don't have to be precise in the ingredient proportions. Personally I like to add more cinnamon, vanilla, and almond extract than what the recipe calls for.
